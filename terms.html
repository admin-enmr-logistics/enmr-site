    <section id="1-intro">
      <h2>1. Introduction &amp; Agreement to Terms</h2>
      <p>Welcome to ENMR Logistics LLC (“ENMR,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our website (the “Site”) and any services we provide. By using the Site or engaging our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Site or our services.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="2-status">
      <h2>2. Company Status &amp; Coordination-Only Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>ENMR operates as a logistics coordinator. We arrange transportation and related services through independent, licensed third-party providers (collectively, “Service Providers”). Unless expressly stated in a separate, written agreement, ENMR does not act as a motor carrier, freight forwarder, NVOCC, air carrier, customs broker, or warehouseman. Our role is limited to coordination on your behalf.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="3-acceptable-use">
      <h2>3. Eligibility &amp; Acceptable Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 18 years old to use the Site or our services.</li>
        <li>You agree not to misuse the Site, introduce malware, scrape data without permission, probe or access non-public areas, or use the Site for unlawful purposes.</li>
        <li>We may suspend or terminate access for any violation of these Terms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="4-services">
      <h2>4. Services Provided</h2>
      <p>We provide logistics coordination, including obtaining quotes, arranging transport with Service Providers, and facilitating communication among parties. The scope for each shipment will be confirmed in writing. Changes to scope may affect pricing, timing, or feasibility.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="5-quotes">
      <h2>5. Quotes, Pricing &amp; Changes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Quotes are estimates based on information available at issuance and may change due to capacity, fuel, surcharges, market conditions, or regulatory changes.</li>
        <li>Service is confirmed only upon written confirmation by ENMR or the relevant Service Provider.</li>
        <li>Schedules and transit times are not guaranteed; ETAs are subject to change.</li>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Providers &amp; Terms</h2>
      <p>Services are performed by independent Service Providers under their own contracts (including bills of lading, tariffs, limitations of liability, and claims procedures).

        <li>Claims for loss, damage, or delay must be filed directly with the responsible Service Provider under their terms and deadlines. ENMR can assist with coordination but does not adjudicate claims and is not liable for outcomes.</li>
